Countries of the World Resource App


Given a data API located here: https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-all

Build an app that:
- displays a list of the countries using a component CountryCard for display
- allows you to click the country card, and display the countries' profile ("region, capital city and population (and any other extra info you'd like to add )"")
- allows you to search for a specific country by name


Use: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/{name}  ({name being the country name}) for searching the name
Use: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all to get all the countries
